<p class=lead>School of Medicine Research Computing (SOMRC) provides state-of-the-art resources and expertise in handling and analyzing genomics and metagenomics data. Bioinformatics is a quickly evolving field with new biological and computational techniques being formalized and adopted at a fast pace. Hence, the following is only a brief cross-section of the ways researchers can use SOMRC’s expertise and computing resources for their bioinformatics research. Please contact SOMRC with your computational questions and needs.</p>

# Next-generation sequence data analyis

SOMRC can support in-depth analysis of various next-generation sequencing experiment datasets on your desktop/[Rivanna](https://arcs.virginia.edu/rivanna)/[Ivy](/userinfo/ivy/)/[AWS](/service/cloud/). Typical analyses include (but not limited to) – 

* Genome assembly, reference-based and/or de-novo
* Whole Genome/Exome Sequence analysis for variant calling/annotation
* RNA-Seq data analysis to quantify, discover and profile RNAs
* Mircobiome data analysis, including 16S rRNA surveys, OTU clustering, microbial profiling, taxonomic and functional analysis from whole shotgun metagenomic/metatranscriptomic datasets
* Epigenetic analysis from BSAS/ChIP-Seq/ATAC-Seq

In addition to above-mentioned generic cookie cutter analyses, SOMRC can work with you to provide customized bioinformatics solutions for specific research goals.

We can advise and collaborate on the various experimental stages, from experimental design, to data processing/analysis/visualization/exploration, as well as downstream statistical modeling for biological insights.  


# Computing Platforms @ UVA

SOMRC can work with your team to determine the computing platform best suited for your research project. 

All faculty, research staff and graduate students of UVA have access to [Rivanna](https://arcs.virginia.edu/rivanna), university's high-performance computing system with 290+ compute nodes (6500+ cores) for high-throughput multithreaded jobs, parallel jobs as well as memmory intensive large-scale data analyses. For a comprehensive list of bioinformatics tools pre-installed on Rivanna [click here](https://arcs.virginia.edu/software-list). We can work with you, and the [ARCS  team](https://arcs.virginia.edu/), to install additional project-specific applications. 

Ivy is a HIPAA compliant cluster at UVA with Domino Data Lab, Hadoop, R, Python, and other computational software to work with sensitive data. For more details [click here](/userinfo/ivy/).

In addition, we can also explore the possibility of using cloud infrastucture (AWS/GCP) for your bioinformatics analysis and data storage. For certain applications, the 'elasticity' of cloud computing may prove beneficial for saving time and reducing costs of data analysis and sharing. The SOMRC team is available for consultation on your project needs.      


# Long-term collaborations
We warmly welcome long-term collaborations with experimentalists and computational biologists. Working with biologists we can chart out experimental design, come up with controls, and think about statistical and computational analyses so the experiment is designed to extract the most value from the data. We can also build and maintain code and pipelines, as well as test new algorithms on multi-core and multi-node architectures.
