<p class=lead>School of Medicine Research Computing supports SOM and UVa Medical Center researchers who are interested in writing code to address their scientific inquiries. Whether these programming tasks are implemented interactively, in a series of scripts or as an open-source software package, services are available to provide guidance and enable collaborative development. SOMRC has specific expertise in object oriented programming in <b>R</b> and <b>Python</b>.</p>

Examples of service areas include:

- Collaborating on package development
- Reviewing and debugging code
- Preparing scripts to automate or expedite tasks
- Developing web interfaces for interactive data exploration
- Advising on integration of existing software tools

- - -

<p class=lead>UVA has two local HPC facilities available to researchers: <b>Rivanna</b> and <b>Ivy</b>. Depending upon your use case, privacy requirements, and the application(s) you need to run, we can help you create an account and start processing your data.</p>

    <h4 class="card-title">Rivanna</h4>
    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Standard Security Cluster</h6>
    <p class="card-text">
    Rivanna provides a high-performance computing environment for all user levels. A majority of Rivannaâ€™s nodes are Cray Cluster Solutions nodes connected by FDR (fourteen data rate) Infiniband, but there are also two nodes with NVIDIA Kepler K20 GPUs, several nodes with QDR (quad data rate) Infiniband, and quite a few older nodes connected with gigabit ethernet.
    </p><p class="card-text">
    All nodes share a Lustre filesystem for temporary storage called <code>/scratch</code> with up to 1.4PB of storage space for all users.   Each user is assigned space in <code>/scratch/$USER</code> with a default quota of 10TB of storage.

    <p class="card-text">
    Ivy provides a secure computing environment for all user levels. It is made up of three tiers, each HIPAA-compliant out of the box:
    <ul>
      <li>VMware virtual compute instances (Windows Server 2012R2 / CentOS Linux)</li>
      <li>Domino Data Lab</li>
      <li>Apache Spark</li>
