<p class=lead>Cloud computing is ideal for running flexible, scalable applications on demand, in periodic bursts, or for fixed periods of time. UVA SOMRC works alongside researchers to design and deploy research applications and datasets into Amazon Web Services, the largest public cloud vendor. This means that server, storage, and database needs do not have to be estimated or purchased beforehand â€“ they can be scaled larger and smaller with your needs, or programmed to scale dynamically with your application. If you have an idea or project and need a proof of concept, we would be happy to sit down and design a cloud solution with you.</p>
