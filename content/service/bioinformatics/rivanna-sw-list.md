Below are additional details on usage of some popular tools - 

**[BWA](/service/bioinformatics/bwa/)** - BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM 


**[Bowtie2](/service/bioinformatics/bowtie2/)** - Bowtie2 is a memory-efficient tool for aligning short sequences to long reference genomes.
