<p class=lead>School of Medicine Research Computing (SOMRC) is committed to providing individualized support for researchers who are engaged in computationally intensive projects.</p>

With expertise in high-performance computing, SOMRC provides support in the following areas:

- [Bioinformatics & Genomics](/service/bioinformatics/)
- [Cloud Solutions](/service/cloud/)
- [Data Analysis](/service/data-analysis/)
- [Scientific Computing](/service/scientific-computing/)

SOMRC delivers the services above in the context of system support (web-based ticketing) and consultations (in-person meetings). In either scenario, we seek long-term scientific collaborations. Please use the contact methods below for user support.

# System Support

Whether you are interested in local computing resources ([Rivanna](http://arcs.virginia.edu/rivanna), [Ivy](/userinfo/ivy/)) or cloud solutions ([Amazon Web Services](/service/cloud/)), SOMRC can help you effectively implement computational strategies.
