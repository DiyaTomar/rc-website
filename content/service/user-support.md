<p class=lead>School of Medicine Research Computing (SOMRC) is committed to providing individualized support for researchers who are engaged in computationally intensive projects.</p>

With expertise in high-performance computing, SOMRC provides support in the following areas:

- [Bioinformatics & Genomics](/service/bioinformatics/)
- [Cloud Solutions](/service/cloud/)
- [Data Analysis](/service/data-analysis/)

SOMRC delivers the services above in the context of system support (web-based ticketing) and consultations (in-person meetings). In either scenario, we seek long-term scientific collaborations. Please use the contact methods below for user support.

# System Support
