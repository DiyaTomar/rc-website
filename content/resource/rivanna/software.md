ARCS offers a variety of standard software packages for all users. We also install requested software based on the needs of the HPC community as a whole. Software used by a single group should be installed by that groupâ€™s members, ideally on leased storage controlled by the group.  Departments with a set of widely-used software packages may install them to the lsp_apps space.  ARCS will also provide limited assistance for individual installations. For help installing research software on your PC, please contact Research Software Support at <a href="mailto:res-consult@virginia.edu">res-consult@virginia.edu</a>.
