# PHACTR1 and Smooth Muscle Cell Behavior

Genome wide associate studies (GWAS) have revealed a number of loci that are associated with increased risk for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). SOMRC is helping analyze phenotypic data collected in vitro in relation to PHACTR1, which is one of the genes associated with CAD. So far this analysis has included interactive visualizations, eQTL plots, merging of genotype and phenotype data and statistical hypothesis testing.

# Relative Proportion of Sites with Intermediate Methylation (RPIM)

SOMRC is working with researchers in the Center for Public Health Genomics to write an R package to calculate RPIM scores, which represent the epigenetic heterogeneity in a bisulfite sequencing sample.
