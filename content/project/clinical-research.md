# Heart Rate and Blood Pressure Analysis 

Pediatricians and neonatologists are interested in identifying normal ranges for vital signs of premature babies. Such metrics are critical to predictive monitoring of patients in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). SOMRC is working with physicians and clinical researchers to write code that manipulates, visualizes and analyzes the heart rate and blood pressure measurements from the available data.

# Hypoxemia Index for Infants

Low blood-oxygen saturation (hypoxemia) can indicate sepsis in neonates. Working with faculty in the Department of Pediatrics, SOMRC is writing and implementing algorithms to identify hypoxemia cases, as well as the relationship between these events and presentations of other vital signs.
