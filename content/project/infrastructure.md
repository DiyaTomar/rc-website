Launching in late 2008, this platform will orchestrate container deployments for both periodic workflows and long-running services.

Some example workloads:

* Web content
* Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
* Pipelines and sequential workflows
* Spark
* See [other available packages](https://universe.dcos.io/#/packages)

Users will create their own Docker images, stored in a UVA Container Registry, and will be able to launch them on-demand. This new cluster will be attached to Qumulo storage, as well as the Globus DTN.

More information coming soon!
