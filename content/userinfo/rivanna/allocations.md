<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning">
Time on Rivanna is allocated as <b>Service Units</b> (SUs). One SU corresponds to one core-hour. Multiple SUs make up what is called an allocation (e.g., a new allocation = 100K SUs). Allocations are managed through <a href="https://mygroups.virginia.edu/" target="_new" style="font-weight:bold;">MyGroups</a> groups that are automatically created for Principal Investigators (PIs) when they submit an allocation request. All UVA faculty, staff, and postdoctoral associates are considered PIs and therefore eligible for an allocation on Rivanna. Students—both graduate and undergraduate—cannot request allocations, but they are allowed to use Rivanna as members of a MyGroups group controlled by a PI.

# Eligibility and Account Creation

University of Virginia tenure stream and academic general faculty, research faculty, research scientists, and postdoctoral associates may request any type of allocation. The different types of allocations are explained below. UVA graduate and undergraduate students are not permitted to request allocations—this must be done by their faculty advisor[s]. UVA staff may request allocations, but are required to provide a detailed project proposal with each request.

RC staff will create a MyGroups account for the faculty or postdoc Principal Investigator (PI) once he/she has submitted an allocation request and will then turn over control of the MyGroups account to the PI. The PI may designate one or more group administrators but must remain a member of the group. Collaborators with UVA Eservices accounts, regardless of status, can be added to the MyGroups group once it has been created. MyGroups group names should consist of lowercase letters, digits, or underscores only and must begin with a letter. Please do not use spaces in the group name.

Each PI is ultimately responsible for managing the roster of users in his/her group although PIs may delegate day-to-day management to one or more other members. When users are added or deleted, accounts are automatically created. PIs who must keep projects separated, such as to distinguish those funded externally from those granted internally, may have more than one allocation group.

# Allocation Types

## Standard allocations
Standard allocations are for 100,000 SUs and require a brief summary of the research project along with an explanation of the computations to be performed. Standard allocations can be renewed (up to three times per year) as long as each renewal request includes a synopsis of results from the original allocation. Available to: Faculty and post-docs using Rivanna for research.

## Administrative allocations
Administrative allocations are granted by the research deans who provide funding for Rivanna. A minimum one-page proposal must be included with any type of administrative allocation request. Available to: Faculty and postdocs who require very large allocations. Choose one of the following administrative request options based on your school/college/organizational affiliation:

* College of Arts and Sciences
* School of Engineering and Applied Science
* All other administrative allocation requests must be submitted to the Data Science Institute

## Allocation purchases
Time on Rivanna can also be purchased using a PTAO. Purchasers are given a higher priority in the queue and their SUs never expire. Available to: Faculty and postdocs with grants; researchers who need priority access and premium service.

## Instructional allocations
Instructional allocations provide limited access to Rivanna and are available to UVA instructors who are teaching a class or leading a training session. Faculty who wish to request an instructional allocation should choose a MyGroups account name using the class rubric, e.g. cs5014.
