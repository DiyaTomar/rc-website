# Free Storage Services

## Libra Data (UVA Dataverse)

<img src="https://data.library.virginia.edu/files/dataverse_project_logo-hp.png" alt="Dataverse" align="right" style="max-width:200px;" />
Datasets and other final, publishable products of research born at UVA may be submitted to Libra Data in order to preserve them and make them accessible worldwide. Libra Data is not intended as storage for works in progress, but is a repostiroy for preservation and sharing.

To learn more about using Libra Data for preservation and sharing, please see the Libra Data FAQs or contact the Libra team for more information.

## Lustre (UVA Rivanna Scratch)

Lustre is an extreme-performance, high-capacity parallel and shared storage system available for research computing at UVA. Lustre is accessible to all researchers on the Rivanna cluster as a personal /scratch folder which can be accessed from anywhere on the cluster. A default quota is defined per user which can be changed upon request. A technical description of the storage system is available on the specifications page. 

The storage is available to all users on Rivanna; to request a startup allocation on Rivanna please complete a request form. To learn more about how this system can support your research, please see the ARCS webpage or contact ARCS for more information.

## Open Science Framework (OSF)

<img src="https://somrc.virginia.edu/images/cos-logo.png" alt="Center for Open Science" align="right" style="max-width:200px;" />
To locate and share collaborative research projects in progress across UVA and other institutions, please consider using UVA's OSF for Institutions. There you can manage projects, encourage transparency, and collaborate with other scholars and affiliate your research with UVA. You can even publish a final research product from OSF directly to Libra Data.

## UVA Box

UVA Box is a cloud-based storage and collaboration service that gives eligible members of the University community the ability to access, store, and share up to 1 TB of non-sensitive/moderately sensitive University files securely â€” anywhere, anytime, on any device.

To see if you have access to UVA Box, please [try the login page](https://virginia.account.box.com/login).

# Fee Storage Services

## Swift Object Storage (UVA)

<img src="https://somrc.virginia.edu/images/swift-logo.png" alt="Center for Open Science" align="right" style="max-width:120px;padding-left:10px;padding-bottom:10px;" />
The Swift object storage system is a high-performance, high-capacity, long-term, and inexpensive storage service. This storage provides individual researchers with an affordable place to store large datasets for access when needed at a later date. It can be made directly accessible from workstations, labs, and clusters as well as from central computing resources.  Its usability as a "live" data storage system for running processes is limited, but it can perform very fast transfers back to the computing system.

A technical description of the storage system is available on the specifications page. To learn more about how this system can support your research, please see the [ARCS webpage](http://arcs.virginia.edu/) or contact ARCS for more information.

## Value Storage (UVA)

Value Storage is a low-cost, moderate-performance version of the Enterprise Storage offered by ITS. It can be mounted from the central network by clients on local laptops and workstations running Linux, Windows, or Mac OSX. Although not as fast as other UVA storage solutions, Value Storage offers a familiar format which is easy to understand and use.  It is differentiated from Enterprise Storage by the lack of higher-level features and services that are available on the Enterprise tiers.

To learn more about how this system can support your research, see the [ARCS webpage](http://arcs.virginia.edu/) or contact one of ARCS computational scientists.

## Enterprise Storage (UVA)

For the highest possible level of data protection for critical and small quantities of research data, ITS offers enterprise-class storage services.  The different tiers of this service offer standard service, replication, and/or backups.

This storage may be ordered from the [ITS Service-Now Catalog](https://uvaprod.service-now.com/).

## Amazon S3 (Cloud)

<img src="https://somrc.virginia.edu/images/aws-s3-icon.png" alt="Amazon S3" align="right" style="max-width:200px;" />
S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a cloud-based, object storage. Files and archives can be stored in S3 securely and privately, as well as shared with specific users or the general
public if so desired. S3 can be accessed via web UI, command-line tools, SDKs, and other common tools that use S3's public API. S3 storage costs approximately $0.03 per GB per month.

For help setting up S3 storage, please contact the SOMRC team <somrc@virginia.edu>.

For more information on working with S3, see our [reference page](https://somrc.virginia.edu/userinfo/reference/s3/).
