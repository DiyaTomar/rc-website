# Help! I deleted my files accidentally!  What can I do?
* Your home directory contains a hidden directory `.snapshot` which is not visible even with `ls -a`.  Change into that directory to find timestamped versions of your home directory.  Snapshots are created once per day.  
* Project (leased) storage also has a `.snapshot` directory.
* Neither Value (leased) nor Rivanna scratch storage is backed up in any way.

# Why should I lease storage?
Leasing storage from Research Computing means that you do not have to run your own data server or backup system.  You can lease storage for lab data without using any of the Research Computing computational resources, or you can lease storage for use with our computing facilities.

# What are my options for leased storage?
Research Computing offers two tiers of leased storage, Value and Project. Please see our [storage page](/userinfo/storage) for details.
