      Amazon S3 and Glacier offer cloud-based, affordable, unlimited capacity for storage from anywhere. Advanced
      features include scalability, lifecycle management, encryption, and sharing. S3 is ideal for static files that
      need to be retrieved from any location (PDFs, images, video, etc.). Glacier is archival storage, perfect for
      grant compliance that reqires data retention.

      Cloud storage is not free. Consideration should be made to the size of your files and how often they will
      be retrieved.
