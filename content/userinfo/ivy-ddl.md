## Features

### Project Structure

DDL is organized into projects, which automatically provision a folder hierarchy to store your code, data, and output. Individuals are able to create new projects, and can also invite other Ivy DDL users to collaboratively view, edit, or run files in an existing project. 

Collaborators can "fork" (copy the contents of) projects, leave comments, and use built-in version control utilities to store / revert changes to files as necessary.

### Uploading Files

To upload a script, dataset or other file, users can navigate to a project and select the "files" menu item. DDL includes a drag-and-drop interface for uploading files less than 550 MB.

### Running code

The DDL platform allows users to run Python and R scripts. To issue a run, navigate to the file you would like to execute and click `Run`. Alternatively you can can use the `Runs` window to start a run by entering the filename. Note that if code is associated with data, it should be written relative to the location of that dataset in the project directory.
