### DevOps Engineer for Research Computing ###

The University of Virginia has recently embarked upon an ambitious effort to improve its research computing infrastructure. The initiatives over the past several years include deployment of a large-scale high-performance computing cluster and a secure virtual-environment data analytics platform; provision of centralized multi-tiered storage solutions; and a recent upgrade of the campus network backbone. 

This much enhanced cyberinfrastructure has set the stage for unprecedented growth in research activity. In order to capitalize on the momentum and to accelerate future scientific breakthroughs using our state-of-the-art computing environment, the University is assembling a world-class team of highly skilled individuals in advanced research computing fields. Individuals with technical competency in HPC and research computing, and those who enjoy the challenges involving complex data and computing problems are strongly encouraged to apply for one or more of the three positions being offered in Information Technology Services (ITS) at the University of Virginia. 

The Research Computing DevOps Engineer will play a critical role in building the research infrastructure to support the University's academic research facilities. Responsibilities will include design, operation and technical support of academic research computing infrastructure. The position will work with other ITS teams, and in cooperation with UVA's other research computing service units in supporting research. This position will also work with new HPC technologies, evaluating potential enhancements to the existing toolset. The goal is to allow our team to look around the next corner, while still executing at a high level. Strong customer service skills and excellent written and oral communication are required.
