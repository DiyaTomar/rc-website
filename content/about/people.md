    <h2>Neal Magee, PhD</h2>
    <p><b>Cloud Solution Architect</b> <br /> Neal designs scaling, service-driven, distributed systems in the public cloud. His recent work has been built primarily in Amazon Web Services, a platform in which he is a certified solution architect. Drawing on a background in development and operations, his work now focuses on "programmable infrastructure" that changes dynamically with the needs of an application. He has extensive experience with Python, the Amazon / Google / Microsoft public clouds, and architecting dynamic systems that scale and heal automatically. Neal is also interested in IoT and data sensor projects that gather large amounts of data.</p>
