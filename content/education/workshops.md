# R For Beginners

**Date**: Tuesday, January 24, 2017 2-5PM

**Time**: 2:00pm - 5:00pm

**Location**: Health Sciences Library Carter Classroom

**Instructor**: VP Nagraj, SOM Research Computing

This workshop is directed towards participants who have little or no experience with statistical computing or programming. R is an open source language that can be used for a variety of computational purposes. This class will introduce R in the context of its data manipulation and visualization capabilities. Via interactive demonstrations, students will learn the basics of creating variables, using functions, accessing documentation, loading packages, importing data and plotting.

# Introduction to the Command Line

**Date**: Tuesday, January 31, 2017

**Time**: 3:00pm - 5:00pm

**Location**: Health Sciences Library Carter Classroom

**Instructor**: VP Nagraj, SOM Research Computing

Mac, Windows and Linux operating systems all included a number of command line utilities for organizing files, manipulating data and executing programs that do not have graphical interfaces. This workshop will introduce participants to a number of commands to perform basic operations in the terminal. No previous experience with the command line is required.

# Advanced Data Manipulation with R

**Date**: Wednesday, February 15, 2017

**Time**: 2:00pm - 5:00pm

**Location**: Health Sciences Library Carter Classroom

**Instructor**: VP Nagraj, SOM Research Computing

Data analysis involves a large amount of janitor work - munging and cleaning data to facilitate downstream data analysis. This workshop is designed for those with a basic familiarity with R who want to learn tools and techniques for advanced data manipulation. It will cover data cleaning and "tidy data," and will introduce participants to R packages that enable data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using split-apply-combine strategies. Upon completing this lesson, participants will be able to use the dplyr package in R to effectively manipulate and conditionally compute summary statistics over subsets of a "big" dataset containing many observations.

# Advanced Data Visualization with R

**Date**: Thursday, February 23, 2017

**Time**: 10:00am - 1:00pm

**Location**: Health Sciences Library Carter Classroom

**Instructor**: VP Nagraj, SOM Research Computing

This workshop will cover fundamental concepts for creating effective data visualization and will introduce tools and techniques for visualizing large, high-dimensional data using R. We will review fundamental concepts for visually displaying quantitative information, such as using series of small multiples, avoiding "chart-junk," and maximizing the data-ink ratio. After briefly covering data visualization using base R graphics, we will introduce the ggplot2 package for advanced high-dimensional visualization. We will cover the grammar of graphics (geoms, aesthetics, stats, and faceting), and using ggplot2 to create plots layer-by-layer. Upon completing this lesson, learners will be able to use ggplot2 to explore a high-dimensional dataset by faceting and scaling scatter plots in small multiples.

# Building Shiny Web Applications in R

Shiny is a framework for developing interactive, web-based tools with R. This workshop will cover how to create a basic user interface, add reactive widgets and publish a Shiny app.

**Date**: Wednesday, April 19, 2017

**Time**: 3:00pm - 5:00pm

**Location**: Health Sciences Library Carter Classroom

**Instructor**: VP Nagraj, SOM Research Computing
