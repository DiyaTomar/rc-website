# BIMS 8382: Introduction to Biomedical Data Science

**Spring 2017**

This course introduces methods, tools, and software for reproducibly managing, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing large-scale biomedical data. Specifically, the course introduces the R statistical computing environment and packages for manipulating and visualizing high-dimensional data, covers strategies for reproducible research, and culminates with analysis of data from a real RNA-seq experiment using R and Bioconductor packages.


# CS 6501: Distributed & Cloud Computing

**Spring 2017**

This graduate course introduces a basic grounding in designing and implementing distributed and cloud systems. It aims to acquaint students with principles and technologies of server clusters, virtualized datacenters, Grids/P2P, Internet clouds, social networks, Internet of Things (IoT), and applications. Students will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience on public cloud such as Amazon EC2. Selected scientific applications will also be used as case studies to gain hands-on experiences.


# DSI Bootcamp: Computing, Storage & Data Analysis in the Cloud

**Summer 2017**

This 1.5 day course introduces MSDS students to the basics of cloud computing in AWS, and the independent management of code, data, and computing resources in a research environment. Particular concern is given to the concepts of programmable, reusable, scalable resources in the AWS cloud, through hands-on labs in EC2 and S3.
