Rivanna will be down for routine maintenance on <strong>Wednesday, December 18 beginning at 6 a.m.</strong> You may continue to submit jobs until the maintenance period ends, but if the system determines your job will not have time to finish, it will not start until Rivanna is returned to service. Rivanna is expected to return to service by 6 a.m. on Friday, December 20.
The JIRA ticketing system will be taken offline on <strong>Wednesday, December 4 from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.</strong> while our system engineers migrate the ticketing system from a local environment to the cloud. Please avoid submitting requests during this period if possible. Although moving to a cloud-based ticketing system will improve the speed and efficiency of our customer service in the long run, in the short-term it may cause disruptions for some users.
If you are unable to login to JIRA after the migration is completed, you will need to change your password using your UVA e-mail address. Please note: Eservices passwords will not work in JIRA cloud.
