School of Medicine Research Computing provides training opportunities covering a variety of data analysis, basic programming 
and computational topics. 

Workshops break roughly into the three main areas relevant to computationally-intensive research: **code**, **data**, and **computing**.

All of the classes are taught by SOMRC experts and are freely available to UVa faculty, staff and students.

* R / R package development
* Python
* Matlab
* Data manipulation
* Data visualization
* Databases
* Cloud Computing
* Containers
* Rivanna (HPC)
* Ivy (Secure Computing)

Be sure to register through the HSL calendar, as space is limited.
