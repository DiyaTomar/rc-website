<p class=lead>Rivanna was down for maintenance on Tuesday, September 17.  The items below summarize the changes that may impact the users of th Rivanna.
</p>


## I.  **Changes to scratch**

System engineers have installed a new /scratch system, and have transferred any files/data that were less than 90 days old from the old scratch system to the new /scratch system.  
Files older than 90 days must be transferred manually from /oldscratch to the new system. 
Instructions for tranferring your files are available here.
RC staff will be in Brown Library, room 145 from 3 to 5 p.m. on Wednesday, September 18 offering technical support for those who need help moving their files from /oldscratch to /scratch. 


- System engineers will be installing a new `/scratch` system with 1.4PB of storage space. Users are encouraged to back up their important data prior to the maintenance period. `/scratch` is intended as temporary storage (90 days maximum) for active work. It is not backed up and needs to be purged periodically in order to maintain a stable HPC environment. Research Computing offers a number of affordable, long-term data storage options to researchers. The current `/scratch` system will be renamed `/oldscratch` after the maintenance period. Data on `/oldscratch` that has been saved within the last 90 days will automatically transfer to the upgraded `/scratch` system. Data older than 90 days will need to be manually transferred from `/oldscratch` to the new system. RC staff will be in Brown Library, Room 145 from 3-5 p.m. on Wednesday, September 18 offering technical support for those who need help moving their files from `/oldscratch` to `/scratch`.</li>
- Users who compile their own code may need to recompile after the maintenance period. A complete list of compiling instructions will be posted on the RC website by noon on 18 September.</li>

If you have any questions or concerns about these changes, please contact our user support team at [hpc-support@virginia.edu](mailto:hpc-support@virginia.edu) prior to 9/17/2019.
