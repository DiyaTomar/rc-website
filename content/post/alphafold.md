We are pleased to announce that AlphaFold is now available on Rivanna! Here are some of our user's first few protein structure prediction calculations on Rivanna.

Simple ZFc protein: Similar results for AlphaFold (brown) and I-TASSER (blue).

146PduD-linker-ZFc protein: AlphaFold's (left) superior ability to predict secondary structure, a β-sheet in its green-yellow region, whereas I-TASSER (right) is not sufficiently refined to feature any β-strands.
