Research Computing (RC) continually updates its policies in response to changing user demands, system requirements, and security compliance.

As a result of new security protocols issued by the Office of Audit and Compliance, we are no longer able to offer Ivy users direct access to the system through HIT's Secure Clinical Network (SCN).

Effective <strong>12/11/19:</strong> All users will need Duo Mobile multi-factor authentication (MFA) and a High Security (HSZ) VPN connection to login to Ivy.

Current VPN users will not be affected by this change, but are advised to migrate to the HSZ VPN and Duo prior to <strong>12/3/19</strong> when Information Technology Services (ITS) will permanently retire UVA Identity Tokens and the Joint Virtual Private Network (JVPN).

For step-by-step instructions on accessing the High Security VPN, click [here] (https://workshops.rc.virginia.edu/lesson/ivy-duo-login/).
