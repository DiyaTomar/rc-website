As part of the September 2019 maintenance for Rivanna, the Research Computing team will replace the `/scratch` file system with new, faster hardware.  
{{% /callout %}}

The Research Computing systems engineers will transfer your files that are no older than 90 days from your currect `/scratch` folder to the new file system.

As a reminder, `/scratch` is temporary storage and files older than 90 days are subject to purging.

## Before the September Maintenance
This is a great opportunity for you to clean out your `/scratch` folder.

Between now and September 17th, we recommend that you:

 * Copy important files to a more permanent location (like /project storage)
 * Delete any old or obselete files.  But, be careful:  `/scratch` files are not backed up.  Deletion is permanent.
 * Use Globus to archive any files to storage outside of the Rivanna system.

## After the September Maintenance

After September 17th, the `/scratch` folder that you are using now will be available until the winter maintenance (planned for December 2019).  You will have the ability to copy any missing files to the new `/scratch` hardware.  

We will post instructions for how you may transfer the missing files after the maintenance.


## Need Help?


If you have questions or need help with transferring your files, Research Computing will hold a "Clinic on Scratch" on Wednesday, September 18 in Brown Library, room 145 from 3 to 5 pm.
