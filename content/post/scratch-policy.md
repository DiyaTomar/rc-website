Beginning 10/14/2019, RC system engineers will periodically remove /scratch files that have not been modified for more than 90 days. /scratch is intended as temporary work directory. It is not backed up and old files need be deleted  periodically in order to maintain a stable HPC environment. We encourage users to back up their important data. RC offers several low-cost storage options to researchers.
