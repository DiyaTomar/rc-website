We are proud to announce the founding of Virginia's first Women in High-Performance Computing (WHPC) program. Join Virginia WHPC for its inaugural event featuring inspiring lightning talks by female faculty of the Commonwealth sharing and discussing how HPC has facilitated their scientific research and professional careers. This virtual event is jointly hosted by Virginia Commonwealth University, George Mason University, Virginia Tech, William & Mary, University of Richmond, and Research Computing at the University of Virginia.

[Register Now!] (https://virginia.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwtd-utpz8jGdezJxL4gctdSQCRft4bcOZB).

Our speakers:
•	<b>Julie Quinn (UVA)</b>

Julianne Quinn is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Engineering Systems and Environment at the University of Virginia. Her research focuses on advancing simulation and optimization methods used to inform the design and management of water resources systems with the goals of protecting people from nature (floods and droughts), and nature from people (pollution and consumption). She is particularly interested in how advanced sensing and forecasting techniques can be used to inform this optimization.

•	<b>Jenna Cann (GMU)</b>

Dr. Jenna Cann is a postdoctoral fellow at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Jenna received a PhD in Physics from George Mason University. Her research focuses on studying black holes in dwarf and low metallicity galaxies, in an effort to constrain the origins of supermassive black holes that can be up to billions of times the mass of our Sun. To do this, they use both theoretical modeling with the Cloudy spectral simulation code and infrared and X-ray observations to determine the most effective ways to find these elusive objects. Jenna currently serves as a co-officer in the NASA Goddard Association for Postdoctoral and Early Career Scholars (NGAPS+) and was a co-founder of the GMU Physics and Astronomy department's diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) organization, SPECTRUM.

•	<b>Grace Chiu (VIMS-W&M)</b>

Grace Chiu is a Professor of Environmental Statistics at William & Mary's Virginia Institute of Marine Science. Her career has spanned three countries (US, Canada, Australia) as an academic and a federal government scientist. In her research, she develops computationally intensive Bayesian models to understand complex natural phenomena from human societies and the environment. At W&M, she teaches statistics to graduate students at the School of Marine Science. For nearly 25 years, she has been a devoted educator of statistics to undergraduate and graduate students from a wide range of disciplines.
Virginia WHPC is committed to increasing diversity and inclusion by promoting and encouraging the participation of women in high-performance computing and related fields.
