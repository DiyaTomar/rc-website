The phrase "cloud computing" has come to mean a lot of things lately: web-based email services, or SaaS (software-as-a-service), or cloud-based storage like UVA's own use of Dropbox. But behind all of these practical, useful tools is what we might call the *real* cloud, made up of impossibly large, globally-scaled hardware farms that our first examples live and run on. These farms make up "cloud infrastructure," and are now sold to consumers by Google, Rackspace, Microsoft, and Amazon. 

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Netflix_2015_logo.svg" align="right" style="margin-left:10px;;max-width:33%;" />This cloud is larger than you probably imagine: One of Amazon's largest customers, Netflix, spins up tens and hundreds of thousands of server instances *every single night* for our viewing pleasure, before they are deleted hours later. Netflix is a great example of how the cloud model works best: large providers such as Amazon Web Services sell computing power on-demand (for pennies an hour) in the form of virtualized servers. While they are operational, Netflix owns them and pays for them. But once they are deleted, they no longer exist and they no longer cost anything for Netflix.

And so, this "infrastructure" that you purchase from a cloud vendor is really just a service. Gone are the days of having to figure out how large a server to purchase, or how many of them, or waiting for them to be delivered so that you can plug them in and start setting them up. In the Amazon, Google, or Microsoft cloud you simply request them and, seconds later, use them. 

This model gives researchers (at least) three powerful features:

1. Quick, disposable environments

2. Environments that can be created repeatedly

3. Low-cost, short-term footprints
