RC system engineers will begin actively clearing /scratch files more than 90 days old beginning 10/14/2019. /scratch is intended as temporary storage (90 days maximum) for active work.
It is not backed up and needs to be purged periodically in order to maintain a stable HPC environment. We encourage users to back up their important data.
RC offers several low-cost storage options to researchers.
