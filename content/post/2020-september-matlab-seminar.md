[REGISTER HERE](https://www.mathworks.com/company/events/seminars/machine-learning-3148877.html) if you'd like to attend - there's no cost and the presenter will be a MathWorks engineer with an advanced degree - not a marketing or sales person.

## Overview

Engineers and scientists work with large amounts of biological data in a variety of formats such as sensor, image, video, databases, and more. They use machine learning to find patterns in data and to build models that predict future outcomes based on historical data.

In this session, we explore the fundamentals of machine learning using MATLAB. We introduce machine learning techniques available in MATLAB to quickly explore your data, evaluate machine learning algorithms, compare the results and apply the best technique to your problem.

## Highlights

   *  Training, evaluating and comparing a range of machine learning models

   *  Using refinement and reduction techniques to create models that best capture the predictive power of your data

   *  Running predictive models in parallel using multiple processors to expedite your results
