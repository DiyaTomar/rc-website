<p class=lead>Rivanna will be down for maintenance on <b>July 16, beginning at 6 a.m.</b> You may continue to submit jobs until the maintenance period begins, but if the system determines your job will not have time to finish, it will not start until Rivanna is returned to service. Rivanna is expected to return to service later in the day.</p>

<p class=lead>As always, we encourage you to back up important data in your <code>/scratch</code> space prior to the maintenance period and/or clean out data that are no longer needed. <code>/scratch</code> is intended as temporary storage (90 days maximum) for active work. It is not backed up and needs to be purged periodically in order to maintain a stable high-performance computing environment.</p>
